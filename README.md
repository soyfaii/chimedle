# chimedle

*chimedle* is a guessing game where you guess video game sound effects (chimes).

* You hear a videogame sound effect.
* You must guess which game (or series) the sound is from for one point.
* If you guess when the sound appears in the game, you get an extra point.
* You have 3 tries. After two fails, you'll get a hint.
* You lose the chance for the extra point in the third try.
